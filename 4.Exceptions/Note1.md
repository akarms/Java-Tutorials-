There are three type of Exceptions 

1. Compile Time Error
2. Run time Error
3. Logical Error

---

## Compile Time Error

Compile time error are those error which are detected by compiler at compile time.

usually these error are syntax error.


## Logical Error

Logical error are those error which are not detected by compiler at compile time.
<br>
This can be happens by wrong logics.
<br>
This cause the program to run but not as expected.
<br>
These can be prevent with the help of testings.
<br>

For example if we are trying to add two number and we are getting wrong output, then it is logical error.


## Run Time Error

Run time error are those error which are not detected by compiler at compile time, and it stop the excecution of the program to run.
<br>
for example when the programe is running and it is trying to access the file which is not present in the system, then it will throw an error and stop the program to run.

<br>

even these type of error happens we have to able to manage the excecution of the code

<br>

That's called **exception Handling**
